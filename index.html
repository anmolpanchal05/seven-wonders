                    The Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, also known as the Seven Wonders
                    of the World or simply the Seven Wonders, is a list of seven notable structures present
                    during classical antiquity. The first known list of seven wonders dates back to the 2nd-1st
                    century BC.
                    While the entries have varied over the centuries, the seven traditional wonders are the Great
                    Pyramid of Giza, the Colossus of Rhodes, the Lighthouse of Alexandria, the Mausoleum at
                    Halicarnassus, the Temple of Artemis, the Statue of Zeus at Olympia, and the Hanging Gardens
                    of Babylon. Using modern-day countries, two of the wonders were located in Greece, two in
                    Turkey, two in Egypt, and one in Iraq. Of the seven wonders, only the Pyramid of Giza, which
                    is also by far the oldest of the wonders, still remains standing, while the others have been
                    destroyed over the centuries. There is scholarly debate over the exact nature of the Hanging
                    Gardens, and there is doubt as to whether they existed at all.

                        Yamuna river in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1632 by
                        the Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658), to house the

                </div>
                <p class="paragraph taj">The Taj Mahal is located on the right bank of the Yamuna River in a vast Mughal
                    garden that
                    encompasses nearly 17 hectares, in the Agra District in Uttar Pradesh. It was built by Mughal
                    Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal with construction starting in 1632 AD
                    and completed in 1648 AD, with the mosque, the guest house and the main gateway on the south,
                    the outer courtyard and its cloisters were added subsequently and completed in 1653 AD. The
                    existence of several historical and Quaranic inscriptions in Arabic script have facilitated
                    setting the chronology of Taj Mahal. For its construction, masons, stone-cutters, inlayers,
                    carvers, painters, calligraphers, dome builders and other artisans were requisitioned from the
                    whole of the empire and also from the Central Asia and Iran. Ustad-Ahmad Lahori was the main
                    architect of the Taj Mahal.
                    The uniqueness of Taj Mahal lies in some truly remarkable innovations carried out by the
                    horticulture planners and architects of Shah Jahan. One such genius planning is the placing
                    of tomb at one end of the quadripartite garden rather than in the exact centre, which added
                    rich depth and perspective to the distant view of the monument. It is also, one of the best
                    examples of raised tomb variety. The tomb is further raised on a square platform with the four
                    sides of the octagonal base of the minarets extended beyond the square at the corners. The top
                    of the platform is reached through a lateral flight of steps provided in the centre of the
                    southern side. The ground plan of the Taj Mahal is in perfect balance of composition, the
                    octagonal tomb chamber in the centre, encompassed by the portal halls and the four corner
                    rooms.</p>

                <p class="paragraph">Taj Mahal represents the finest architectural and artistic achievement through
                    perfect harmony and excellent craftsmanship in a whole range of Indo-Islamic sepulchral
                    architecture. It is a masterpiece of architectural style in conception, treatment and
                    execution and has unique aesthetic qualities in balance, symmetry and harmonious blending
                    of various elements.</p>

                <p class="topic">Integrity</p>

                <p class="paragraph">Integrity is maintained in the intactness of tomb, mosque, guest house, main gate
                    and the
                    whole Taj Mahal complex. The physical fabric is in good condition and structural stability,
                    nature of foundation, verticality of the minarets and other constructional aspects of Taj
                    Mahal have been studied and continue to be monitored. To control the impact of deterioration
                    due for atmospheric pollutants, an air control monitoring station is installed to constantly
                    monitor air quality and control decay factors as they arise. To ensure the protection of the
                    setting, the adequate management and enforcement of regulations in the extended buffer zone
                    is needed. In addition, future development for tourist facilities will need to ensure that
                    the functional and visual integrity of the property is maintained, particularly in the
                    relationship with the Agra Fort.</p>

                <p class="topic">Authenticity</p>

                <p class="paragraph">The tomb, mosque, guest house, main gate and the overall Taj Mahal complex have
                    maintained
                    the conditions of authenticity at the time of inscription. Although an important amount of
                    repairs and conservation works have been carried out right from the British period in India
                    these have not compromised to the original qualities of the buildings. Future conservation
                    work will need to follow guidelines that ensure that qualities such as form and design
                    continue to be preserved.</p>

                <p class="topic">Protection and management requirements</p>

                <p class="paragraph">The management of Taj Mahal complex is carried out by the Archaeological Survey of
                    India
                    and the legal protection of the monument and the control over the regulated area around
                    the monument is through the various legislative and regulatory frameworks that have been
                    established, including the Ancient Monument and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act 1958
                    and Rules 1959 Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains
                    (Amendment and Validation); which is adequate to the overall administration of the property
                    and buffer areas. Additional supplementary laws ensure the protection of the property in
                    terms of development in the surroundings.

                    An area of 10,400 sq km around the Taj Mahal is defined to protect the monument from
                    pollution. The Supreme Court of India in December, 1996, delivered a ruling banning use
                    of coal/coke in industries located in the Taj Trapezium Zone (TTZ) and switching over to
                    natural gas or relocating them outside the TTZ. The TTZ comprises of 40 protected monuments
                    including three World Heritage Sites - Taj Mahal, Agra Fort and Fatehpur Sikri.

                    The fund provided by the federal government is adequate for the buffer areas. The fund
                    provided by the federal government is adequate for the overall conservation, preservation
                    and maintenance of the complex to supervise activities at the site under the guidance of
                    the Superintending Archaeologist of the Agra Circle. The implementation of an Integrated
                    Management plan is necessary to ensure that the property maintains the existing conditions,
                    particularly in the light of significant pressures derived from visitation that will need
                    to be adequately managed. The Management plan should also prescribe adequate guidelines for
                    proposed infrastructure development and establish a comprehensive Public Use plan

                </div>
                <p class="paragraph">The town of Chichen-Itza was established during the Classic period close to two
                    natural cavities
                    (cenotes or chenes), which gave the town its name "At the edge of the well of the Itzaes". The
                    cenotes facilitated tapping the underground waters of the area. The dates for this settlement
                    vary according to subsequent local accounts: one manuscript gives 415-35 A.D., while others
                    mention 455 A.D. The town that grew up around the sector known as Chichen Viejo already boasted
                    important monuments of great interest: the Nunnery, the Church, Akab Dzib, Chichan Chob, the
                    Temple of the Panels and the Temple of the Deer. They were constructed between the 6th and the
                    10th centuries in the characteristic Maya style then popular both in the northern and southern
                    areas of the Puuc hills.
                    The second settlement of Chichen-Itza, and the most important for historians, corresponded to
                    the migration of Toltec warriors from the Mexican plateau towards the south during the 10th
                    century. According to the most common version, the King of Tula, Ce Acatl Topiltzin
                    Quetzalcoatl, or Kukulkan as the Maya translated the name, reportedly took the city between 967
                    A.D. and 987 A.D. After the 13th century no major monuments seem to have been constructed at
                    Chichen-Itza and
                    the city rapidly declined after around 1440 A.D. The ruins were not excavated until 1841 A.D.</p>

                    the centre of the Roman Republic, then of the Roman Empire, and in the fourth century, became
                    the capital of the Christian world. Ancient Rome was followed, from the 4th century on, by
                    Christian Rome. The Christian city was built on top of the ancient city, reusing spaces,
                    buildings and materials. From the 15th century on, the Popes promoted a profound renewal of
                    the city and its image, reflecting the spirit of the Renaissance classicism and, later, of
                    the Baroque. From its foundation, Rome has continually been linked with the history of
                    humanity. As the capital of an empire which dominated the Mediterranean world for many
                    centuries, Rome became thereafter the spiritual capital of the Christian world. </p>

                    management system allowed extensive settlement of an essentially arid area during the Nabataean,

                    AD on the
                    northern border of the country as the great military defence project of successive Chinese
                    Empires, with a total length of more than 20,000 kilometers. The Great Wall begins in the east
                    at Shanhaiguan in Hebei province and ends at Jiayuguan in Gansu province to the west. Its main
                    body consists of walls, horse tracks, watch towers, and shelters on the wall, and includes
                    fortresses and passes along the Wall.
                    The Great Wall reflects collision and exchanges between agricultural civilizations and nomadic
                    civilizations in ancient China. It provides significant physical evidence of the far-sighted
                    political strategic thinking and mighty military and national defence forces of central empires
                    in ancient China, and is an outstanding example of the superb military architecture, technology
                    and art of ancient China. It embodies unparalleled significance as the national symbol for
                    safeguarding the security of the country and its people.</p>

                    Andes and the Amazon Basin, the Historic Sanctuary of Machu Picchu is among the greatest artistic,
                    architectural and land use achievements anywhere and the most significant tangible legacy of the
                    Inca civilization. Recognized for outstanding cultural and natural values, the mixed World Heritage
                    property covers 32,592 hectares of mountain slopes, peaks and valleys surrounding its heart, the
                    spectacular archaeological monument of “La Ciudadela” (the Citadel) at more than 2,400 meters above
                    sea level. Built in the fifteenth century Machu Picchu was abandoned when the Inca Empire was
                    conquered by the Spaniards in the sixteenth century. It was not until 1911 that the archaeological
                    complex was made known to the outside world.
                    The approximately 200 structures making up this outstanding religious, ceremonial, astronomical and
                    agricultural centre are set on a steep ridge, crisscrossed by stone terraces. Following a rigorous
                    plan the city is divided into a lower and upper part, separating the farming from residential areas,
                    with a large square between the two. To this day, many of Machu Picchu’s mysteries remain
                    unresolved, including the exact role it may have played in the Incas’ sophisticated understanding of
                    astronomy and domestication of wild plant species.

                    Machu Picchu are clearly defined and the protected area is surrounded by a buffer zone exceeding the
                    size of the property.
                    The Management Unit of the Historic Sanctuary of Machu Picchu (UGM) was established in 1999 to lead
                    the strategies contained in the Master Plans, which are the regularly updated governing documents
                    for the management of the property. UGM was reactivated in 2011 and is comprised of representatives
                    of the Ministries of Culture, Environment and Foreign Trade and Tourism, the Regional Government of
                    Cusco, serving as the President of the Executive Committee, and the local municipality of Machu
                    Picchu. A platform bringing together key governmental representatives at all levels is indispensable
                    for the management of a property which forms part of Peru’s very identity and is the country’s
                    primary domestic and international tourist destination.
                    Notwithstanding the adequate legislative and formal management framework, there are important
                    challenges to the inter-institutional governance and the effectiveness of management and protection
                    of the property. The dispersed legislation would benefit from further harmonization and despite
                    existing efforts the involvement of various ministries and governmental levels ranging from local to
                    national remains a complex task, including in light of the sharing of the significant tourism
                    revenues. Tourism itself represents a double-edged sword by providing economic benefits but also by
                    resulting in major cultural and ecological impacts. The strongly increasing number of visitors to
                    the Historic Sanctuary of Machu Picchu must be matched by an adequate management regulating access,
                    diversifying the offer and efforts to fully understand and minimize impacts. A larger appropriate
                    and increasing share of the significant tourism revenues could be re-invested in planning and
                    management. The planning and organization of transportation and infrastructure construction, as well
                    as the sanitary and safety conditions for both tourists and new residents attracted by tourism
                    requires the creation of high quality and new long-term solutions, and is a significant ongoing
                    concern.
